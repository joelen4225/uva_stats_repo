# Predicting Hits with MLB Swing Data

In this repository, you will find our team's (UVA Stats) submission to the Kaggle competition titled 'Predict hits with NEW MLB swing data'. This competition was put on by Nick Wan of the Reds who also provided a benchmark solution to guide contestants through the process. His solution came out to a ROC AUC Score of 0.6924. Our goal was to come up with a model to perform better than that.
